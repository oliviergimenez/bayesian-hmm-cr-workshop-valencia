      "contents": "\nWhat: This is a workshop on Bayesian inference of animal demography. Hopefully, you will learn about how to infer demographic parameters (e.g. survival, dispersal). Our hope is to provide you with what you need to go your own path. The event is free of charge, and video-recorded.\nFor whom: This is a workshop for ecologists. No previous experience with Nimble or Bayesian statistics is assumed, but knowledge of R is required.\nHow: Through a combination of lectures and live demonstrations, you will get acquainted with the Bayesian approach, MCMC methods and the R Nimble package to fit single-site, multi-site, multi-state and multi-event models to capture-recapture data within the hidden Markov modeling (HMM) framework.\nWho: O. Gimenez\nWhen: July 12-13, 2023\nWhere: València VIBASS\nProgram\nDay 1\nWelcoming words (9am-9:30am)\nCrash course on Bayesian statistics and MCMC algorithms (9:30am-11am)\nFree the modeler in you: Introduction to Nimble (11:30am-12:30pm)\nWhat you see is not what you get: Hidden Markov models and capture-recapture data (2pm-3:30pm)\nDead or alive: Survival estimation - part 1 (4pm-5pm)\nDay 2\nDead or alive: Survival estimation - part 2 (9am-10:30am)\nOn the move: Transition estimation (11am-12:30pm)\nKnown knowns, unknown knowns and unknowns: Uncertainty in state assignment (2pm-3:30pm)\nSkip your coffee break: Speed up MCMC convergence (4pm-5pm)\nTake-home messages (5pm-5:30pm)\nRequirements\nInstall R and RStudio.\nInstall Nimble following these guidelines. Then run the following code in R. If that runs without error, you’re all set. If not, please get in touch with us.\n\n\nlibrary(nimble)\n  code <- nimbleCode({\n  y ~ dnorm(0,1)\n  })\n  model <- nimbleModel(code)\n  cModel <- compileNimble(model)\n\n\nInstall the following R packages: tidyverse, MCMCvis, here and nimbleEcology. You can install them all at once by running the following code in R:\n\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"MCMCvis\", \"here\", \"nimbleEcology\"))\n\n\nTo-do list\nAdd examples of sensitivity analyses.\nMake class number match name of live demos html and R scripts files.\nAdd messages in the video recordings about typos in the slides.\nIn Nimble code for multievent models, change observation matrix at first encounter omega.init into omega.firste to avoid confusion with vector of initial state probabilities.\nReuse\nText and figures are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 4.0.
